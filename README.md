This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript functions: failure to explicitly return a value under certain conditions. The function `f` is defined, but it only assigns a value to `f` if `x` is greater than 10. If `x` is not greater than 10, the function implicitly returns a default value (usually 0), leading to unexpected results.  The solution shows how to correct this by explicitly returning a value in both branches of the conditional statement.
